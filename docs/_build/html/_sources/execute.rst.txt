Execute Stage (EX)
==================

The Execute Stage (:file:`rtl/toast_EX_stage`) is comprised of the ALU and Branch Gen unit. It is responsible for muxing the correct operands into the ALU as well as determining whether a conditional branch is taken or not.


ALU:
----

The ALU (:file:`rtl/toast_alu`) is implemented using combinatorial logic and is capable of executing 11 different operations on two operands. 

- **Arithmetic/Logical**: add, subtract, AND, OR, XOR

- **Shifts:** Shift Left Logical, Shift Right Logical, Shift Right Arithmetic

- **Tests:** Set Equal, Set Less Than, Set Less Than Unsigned


Branch Gen:
-----------

The Branch Gen unit (:file:`toast_branchgen`) is implemeted using combinatorial logic and computes either a PC-relative target or register-offset target based on the control signal generated by the decoder.
